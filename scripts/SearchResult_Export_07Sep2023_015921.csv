 Immune checkpoints (ICPs) exert inhibitory or stimulatory effects on immune defense, surveillance,
regulation, and self-tolerance through their ligand-receptor interactions. ICPs exist in both membrane-bound
and soluble forms in vivo. Imbalances between inhibitory and stimulatory membrane-bound ICPs (mICPs) in
malignant cells and immune cells in the peripheral blood and tissues have been well documented. Blockade of
inhibitory mICPs such as CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1 has become a revolutionary treatment for advanced
stages of malignancies such as melanoma. However, the origin, regulation, and biological significance of both
mICPs and soluble ICPs (sICPs) in the central nervous system (CNS) have not yet been systematically
studied. We used a multiplex immunoassay to simultaneously quantify the concentrations of 16 sICPs in
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 33 HIV-negative individuals (HNIs) and 105 people living with HIV
(PLWH), including 80 cases with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) and 25 cases without HAND.
We found that 10 sICPs (sHVEM, sCD27, sGITR, sICOS, sLAG-3, sPD-1, sTIM-3, sBTLA, sCD28, & sCD40)
were consistently detected in all CSF samples, and most of them were highly elevated in PLWH. Strikingly,
CSF sHVEM was significantly increased in HAND when compared to PLWH without HAND. These 10 sICPs
were also detectable in the CSF samples from rhesus macaques (RMs). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis
of brain tissues (frontal cortex and hippocampus) from RMs with and without simian immunodeficiency virus
(SIV) infection showed that mHVEM was expressed at a basal level on neurons, but not on astrocytes or
microglia, and mHVEM expression was highly increased in SIV-infected RMs (SIV/RMs). Furthermore, we
have recently reported that PD-L1 expression in U87MG cells (a human astrocyte cell line) can be robustly
induced by a mixture of IFN-γ/IL-1β/TNF-α, and induced PD-L1 controls production of MCP-1 (the most
important chemokine that regulates migration of monocytes/macrophages) via PD-L1 intrinsic signaling. Thus,
we hypothesize that both sICPs and mICPs are dysregulated in the CNS of PLWH, which are associated with
HAND neuropathogenesis. We have two Specific Aims to test this central hypothesis: (1) To determine sICP
profiles and biological functions in the CNS of PLWH and SIV/RMs, and (2) To characterize the cellular niches
and spatial associations of ICP receptor/ligand-positive neural cells and infiltrating immune cells in the brain of
PLWH and SIV/RMs. Our results will provide insights into the roles of ICPs in the CNS neuroimmune
dysregulation and neuroinflammation of PLHIV with and without HAND. The CSF levels and profiles of sICPs
such as sHVEM can potentially be used as a biomarker for HAND severity and progression.","823691",

intervention, suggesting pediatric HIV remission is achievable in a proportion of infants infected with or exposed

intervention strategies for a sustained state of ART-free viral remission, and exploring the antiretroviral
pharmacokinetics and immune alteration in unique infants using early prevention interventions, will accelerate

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Despite remarkable advances in prevention of vertical HIV-1 transmission, however, there is little data to guide
the optimal early treatment regimens in vulnerable neonates with high risk of MTCT. Current recommended
antiretroviral regimens for children are extrapolated from clinical trial in adults. Most recently, our studies show
that a short-term combined ART (cART) incorporating an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), initiated at
3 days post infection (dpi) but not one day beyond, can rapidly suppress viremia to undetectable levels in
neonates, and a prolonged 9-month-early intervention of this regimen results in sustained virologic remission in
4 of 5 infants for more than 2.5 years after treatment cessation. Surprisingly, our further preliminary data showed
that delaying treatment (e.g., newborn macaques inoculated with SIV/SHIV AD8 and cART initiated at 5dpi) or
treating older infants (e.g., 1.5-month old infant macaques exposed to SIV with cART initiated at 3dpi) drastically
altered the outcomes after interruption of the same 9-month-early intervention, as indicated by viral rebound in
4/5 and 3/3 animals, respectively. These findings suggest that outcome of pediatric sustained virologic remission
appears to be very sensitive to the age of infants (e.g., newborn versus infants) and the timing (e.g., proviral
reservoir seeding?) of intervention initiation, yet the exact mechanisms of viral remission remain elusive. New
antivirals are also emerging and a once-monthly analog of DTG called cabotegravir (CAB) shows even greater
potential for preventing HIV acquisition and replication in recent adult clinical trials, yet its efficacy and safety in
pediatric HIV therapy have not been examined. Given newborn neonates lack well-organized lymphoid tissues
(sanctuary sites for antiretrovirals penetration and viral reservoirs) while possessing more dynamic and
regenerative capacity than an adult, prophylactic intervention in infants may be unique in that it may have more
effective antiviral activity for ART-free HIV remission, resulting in more replenishment of key immune cells and
normal development of the immune system. In this proposal, we hypothesize that early prevention interventions,
based on appropriate initial timing, duration and INSTI combination, could effectively block viral genome
integration and completely eliminate early viral reservoirs, resulting in a sustained state of ART-free virologic
remission in infants exposed to or infected with HIV, and subsequently, normal immune development throughout
infancy. Utilizing the pediatric NHP model of HIV, our overarching objective is address: SA1, the impact of
proviral reservoirs on prophylactic intervention outcomes in infants while assessing the efficacy and safety of
cabotegravir in a preclinical trial; SA2, the optimum prevention intervention strategy for achieving pediatric HIV
remission, and; SA3, the pharmacokinetics and immunological alterations of ART in the unique infant primate
host. Overall, these studies will provide insight into the optimal prevention intervention that achieves a sustained
state of ART-free virologic remission for infants exposed to or infected with HIV at birth, which will have significant
translational significance towards the treatment of HIV infection of infants in general.","781224",

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementia (AD/ADRD) is a multifactorial and heterogeneous disorder. Most
current studies focus on drug interventions for AD/ADRD and currently none of pharmacological intervention (PI)
discovery research has been translated into effective treatments. However, increasing evidence demonstrates
that non-pharmacological interventions (NPI), such as sleep, diet, dietary supplements, aerobic exercise,
aromatherapy, light therapy, cognitive training, are potentially modifiable and thus offer alternative opportunities
for AD/ADRD prevention. Thus, the objective of this project is to develop translational informatics approaches to
aggregate, standardize and discover the effects of drug and NPI candidates on AD/ADRD using multi-modal
data resources (i.e., biomedical literature, EHR, clinical trials) followed by animal model validation. To achieve
our goal, we propose the following aims: 1) constructing a comprehensive Pharmacological And Non-
Pharmacological Interventions for Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Graph (PANIA-KG) from biomedical literature
and other knowledge bases; 2) detecting, understanding, and visualization of drug repurposing signals of PIs,
NPIs, and their synergistical effects for AD/ADRD using the PANIA-KG; 3) re-ranking and validating individual
and synergistical drug repurposing signals using multimodal data sources and animal models. The successful
completion of this project will deliver a comprehensive NPI knowledge graph, novel informatics approaches,
ranked list of drug and NPI candidates, and validated synergistic intervention using multi-modal data sources.
The generated approaches, PANIA-KG and ranked lists can further our clinical investigations and clinical trial
design which focuses on synergistic effects of drug and NPIs for AD/ADRD.","762782",

The normal structure and function of the dentin-pulp complex in adult permanent teeth can be affected by the exposure of
a vital pulp following deep caries removal, traumatic injuries, or accidental restorative procedures. To stimulate dentin
repair, preserve pulp vitality and avoid more invasive and costly procedures, vital pulp therapy relies on direct pulp-capping
agents. These are mainly composed of inorganic hydraulic calcium-silicate cements, where mineral trioxide aggregate
(MTA) is often considered the gold standard. Despite its well-accepted therapeutic value, it remains unclear which specific
underlying signaling mechanisms orchestrate reparative dentinogenesis through the differentiation of dental pulp stem cells
(DPSCs) into odontoblast-like cells. Also, common drawbacks associated with MTA include long setting times and high
cost. Thus, enhancing dentin repair through novel, substantially more affordable bioactive formulations with improved
physico-mechanical properties that molecularly target the pulp cells responsible for its synthesis could translate into truly
beneficial and highly cost-effective therapeutic outcomes. We provide the first evidence supporting the development of a
novel biomaterial formulated with calcium phosphate cement/chitosan (CPCC) and metformin (Met), that triggered a
significant upregulation in the expression of odontoblastic differentiation markers and mineral synthesis in DPSCs. Met is
a widely used, safe and low-cost oral anti-diabetic biguanide drug, and potent activator of the AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) signaling pathway, a master sensing mechanism of cellular bioenergetics. These promising preliminary data imply
that Met could be safely repurposed within locally delivered formulations to enhance reparative dentin by molecularly
targeting AMPK. In the proposed studies, we seek to maximize dentin repair by developing a new Met-CPCC pulp-capping
agent with similar mechanical and flowability properties like MTA but with a substantial, several folds of reduction in
setting time and cost. This innovative formulation relies on Met to induce AMPK activation and odontoblastic differentiation
in DPSCs, and CPCC to provide the alkaline, ionic building blocks for hydroxyapatite formation. To that end, we will test
the central hypothesis that dentin repair following vital pulp exposure is significantly potentiated by a Met-releasing CPCC
bioactive pulp-capping agent through AMPK activation and delivery of mineralized tissue-building ions. In vitro and in
vivo studies will expand our initial findings through two specific aims. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that in DPSCs, a novel
Met-CPCC pulp-capping agent induces odontogenic responses in an AMPK-dependent manner. In Aim 2, we will test the
hypothesis that Met-CPCC pulp-capping agent significantly enhances dentin repair and increases the hardness and elastic
modulus of new dentin in a rat dentin injury model with pulp exposure in vivo. The long-term goal of this proposal is to
potentiate reparative dentinogenesis with novel biologically active Met-containing dental materials targeting AMPK
activation, yielding new mechanisms and improved treatments that are widely applicable to restorative and regenerative
dentistry.","231750",

Large observational data such as electronic health records (EHRs) and medical claims have
become an enabling source for facilitating clinical and translational research including Alzheimer's
Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementia (AD/ADRD). One major challenge for

repository for hosting and standardizing phenotype definitions in AD/ADRD research and few
methods have been developed to address bias associated with phenotyping errors in observation
data. Therefore, the overarching goal of this proposal is to fully develop a joint effort between
medical informaticians, statisticians, clinicians, and epidemiologists with a focus on building a
rigorous set of methods and tools for managing phenotype definitions and for correcting bias in
observational data analysis, through modern knowledge engineering and data-driven statistical

normalize, and share definitions of common phenotypes used in AD/ADRD observational

when users apply existing phenotype definitions to local data; and (3) Aim 3 - Validate, refine, and
disseminate proposed methods and tools by demonstration studies and community engagement.

Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) along with other age-related
neurodegenerative diseases contribute to significant morbidity and costs for the aging population
worldwide. Advances in this field have uncovered that bilingualism is a protective factor that
delays onset of ADRD and may enhance cognitive reserve. Still, little is clearly known about the
direct impact of bilingualism on cognitive reserve and ADRD progression; multiple, entangled
confounding variables, such as lifestyle and psychological resilience, complicate the relationship
between bilingualism and cognition and warrant further investigation. Other major shortcomings
in previous studies include small sample size, lack of population diversity and insufficient data on
relevant covariates. We aim to address these critical gaps via the following specific aims.
In Aim 1, we will leverage advanced informatics and longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs)
from millions of patients across three geographically and demographically diverse sites (i.e., MGB
[Boston, MA], UTHealth [Houston, TX], and UC Davis [Sacramento, CA]). We will develop robust
algorithms to identify potential monolingual and bilingual cohorts and their phenotypes. We will
disseminate reproducible informatics methods to support research cross-institutionally.
In Aim 2, we will conduct a prospective cohort study to evaluate the dynamic cognitive changes
in monolingual and bilingual older adults. We will explore potential pathways by which bilingualism
impacts cognitive decline over time using comprehensive instruments and surveys to repeatedly
measure cognitive resilience, cognitive reserve, and related factors, including social support,
psychological resilience, and physical activity.
In Aim 3, we will develop and validate machine learning algorithms to identify onset of age-related
cognitive decline and dementia using EHR data. We will apply the validated language classifier
for all participating EHR systems to examine the role of bilingualism in relation to the progression
of cognitive decline and the effect of other factors recorded in EHR data.
By integrating multiple disciplines to explore the influence of bilingualism on cognitive reserve,
this proposed design will address major gaps and challenges in this field. Such research has the
potential to transform the current understanding of neural and behavioral pathways in relation to
language, culture, and environment. Furthermore, the knowledge gained may translate to
improvements in existing interventions and novel therapeutic approaches for ADRD.","1411758",

The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop widely applicable, cost-effective bone tissue engineering platforms that
combine metformin with stem cells to regenerate large, critical-sized oral and craniofacial skeletal defects. Although tissue
engineering using stem cells, scaffolds and growth factors offers an attractive, less invasive alternative to autologous bone
grafts, its success highly depends on the proper adaptation of cells to a local hypoxic microenvironment, and reestablishment
of a functional microvasculature. It is well established that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key mediator of
osteogenic/angiogenic coupling in bone regeneration. Thus, developing novel and affordable stem cell-based tissue engineering
strategies that potentiate VEGF-mediated angiogenesis may significantly enhance skeletal regeneration. Our group and others
recently reported that metformin, a low-cost drug used by millions of diabetics worldwide induces the osteoblastic
differentiation of stem cells derived from various tissue sources. This suggests that metformin could be repurposed in a local
delivery formulation to potentiate stem cell-based bone regeneration. We have advanced this concept by formulating a calcium
phosphate cement (CPC) containing metformin that when released in culture upregulated the expression of osteogenic
markers and increased mineralized extracellular deposits in dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), an easily accessible and
inexhaustible source of postnatal stem cells. Intriguingly, we have found that metformin also induces a significant increase in
VEGF secretion that is further amplified in DPSCs exposed to hypoxic conditions. The osteogenic action of metformin has
been associated with the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, a master sensing
mechanism of cellular bioenergetics. While in hepatocytes, metformin reduces high blood glucose production by activating
AMPK via the upstream kinase liver kinase B1 (LKB1), a mechanistic, translationally relevant question that still remains
elusive is whether DPSCs rely mainly on LKB1 to enhance bone formation and neovascularization in response to locally
delivered metformin. We will test the central hypothesis that DPSC-based craniofacial bone regeneration and
neovascularization in response to locally delivered metformin is enhanced by AMPK activation through a functional,
catalytically active LKB1. In vitro and in vivo studies will expand our results through two specific aims. Aim 1 will
determine whether in DPSCs, metformin released from CPC scaffolds induces osteogenic and pro-angiogenic responses in
an LKB1/AMPK-dependent manner. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that in DPSCs, a functional LKB1/AMPK cellular
response is necessary to enhance craniofacial bone regeneration and neovascularization in response to locally delivered
metformin released from CPC scaffolds. We anticipate our results will yield new, valuable basic and translational
information that will lead to cost-effective tissue engineering platforms where metformin-loaded scaffolds in combination
with stem cells will enhance craniofacial and orthopedic bone regeneration.","231750",

In this project, we propose to develop novel informatics approaches to automatically extract detailed clinical
information about Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD) patients (e.g.,
disease diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and response) from heterogeneous electronic health records
databases. This technology will allow more efficient information extraction from patients' records, thus

As the 6th leading cause of death in the US, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related
dementias (ADRD) affect about 5.7 million Americans. However, up until now, our understanding of risk factors
of AD/ADRD is still limited and our efforts on developing effective treatments for AD/ADRD have been greatly
disappointing. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new methods to conduct AD/ADRD research
more efficiently. One of the potential approaches is to leverage large, longitudinal, observational clinical data
accumulated in electronic health records (EHRs). Nevertheless, current uses of EHRs for AD/ADRD research
is very limited, often requiring manual data extraction and normalization (i.e., manual chart review), which is
labor-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, in this study, we plan to develop novel ontology and natural
language processing (NLP) based informatics methods and tools to automatically extract and normalize
AD/ADRD-related clinical data in EHRs, thus facilitating efficient AD/ADRD observational studies using EHRs.
We propose the following three specific aims to achieve this goal: 1) Build an information model for EHR-based
AD/ADRD research using a formal ontology representation approach; and 2) Extract and normalize AD/ADRD
information in clinical documents using NLP technologies; and 3) Evaluate developed informatics methods and
tools through demonstration studies and disseminate them to support observational AD/ADRD research.","2371994",
