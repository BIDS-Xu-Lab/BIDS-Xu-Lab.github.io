Summary: "Clinical NLP Commercialization – Before and After the Era of LLMs" by Dr. Hua Xu

We are thrilled to announce the successful launch of the second Yale NLP (Natural Language Processing) LLM Interest Group! The meeting, held on March 6th, 2024, was attended by a diverse group of enthusiastic individuals, including students, researchers, and engineers, all sharing a common interest in exploring the intersection of law, language, and technology.

Dr. Hua Xu delivered a presentation titled:

**Title: Clinical NLP Commercialization – Before and After the Era of LLMs**
 
**Abstract**: Generative AI technologies (e.g., large language models – LLMs) have significantly transformed the realm of natural language processing, including its applications in healthcare and life sciences. In this presentation, Dr. Xu will begin by sharing his insights into the commercialization journey of CLAMP, a clinical NLP system based on machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Following this, we will engage in an open discussion to explore the opportunities and challenges associated with commercializing NLP tools and applications developed within academic spheres, especially amidst the emergence of LLMs.
