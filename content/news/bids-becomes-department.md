Summary: Our humble section has completed its official transition to a department within the Yale School of Medicine!

At a lavish reception on the 14th floor of Kline Tower at Yale, we celebrated the official transition of our home academic unit, Biomedical Informatics and Data Science, from a section to a department within the Yale School of Medicine. BIDS has experienced rapid, exciting growth in less than a year and a half and continues to display immense potential under the stewardship of our chair Lucila Ohno-Machado.
