### Speaker bio:

In the rapidly evolving field of biomedicine, researchers are inundated with ever-growing datasets. This massive accumulation of biomedical knowledge poses a significant challenge in terms of efficient data navigation and exploration. While existing tools may provide support for data searching and browsing, gaps persist in enabling efficient data exploration and knowledge discovery. In this presentation, I will present a few case studies that leverage interactive visualization and machine learning techniques to empower users to better explore different types of biomedical datasets, such as text data, tabular data, and high-dimensional data.
