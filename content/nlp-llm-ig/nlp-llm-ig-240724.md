### Speaker bio:

We envision "AI scientists" as collaborative agents capable of reasoning and coding that empower biomedical research. I will first demonstrate MedAgents, the first multi-agent framework in the medical field. MedAgents examines how large language models (LLMs) can be used as collaborative experts to enhance medical reasoning through multi-round discussions. Then, I will briefly present our works on benchmarking existing LLMs on bioinformatics code generation and agents on repository-level data science tasks. Finally, while LLMs' capabilities are promising, I will highlight vulnerabilities and potential risks associated with their misuse and emphasize the need for safety measures.
