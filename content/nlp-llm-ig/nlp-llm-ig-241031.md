### Speaker bio:

Medical large language models (MedLLMs) have demonstrated advanced capabilities across various medical tasks, e.g., medical question answering and text summarization. Despite the remarkable advancements, MedLLMs are confronted with several privacy and copyright challenges. For example, they memorize and regenerate large amounts of segments of their training data instances at inference time, which potentially leak patients' protected health information (PHI) to third parties. These concerns emphasize the importance of exploring the capability of MedLLMs to memorize their training data, especially given the fact that the medical training data are much sensitive and is copyrighted. In this project, we demonstrate that MedLLMs memorize and leak individual training samples.We propose an effective method for extracting memorized contents and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of memorization of medical LLMs. We aim to achieve the following objectives in this project. First, we aim to systematically investigate and quantify the memorization in large medical models, highlighting the potential risks of memorization in medical models. Second, we aim to analyze factors that influence memorization of MedLLMs. Third, we aim to explore whether we can identify copyrighted data because of memorization. Finally, we aim to mitigate memorization issues in the model development and release process.
